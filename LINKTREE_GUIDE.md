## How to Customize

All customization is done in the `index.html` file. Look for the `config` object in the `<script>` section:

### 1. Update Profile Information
```javascript
const config = {
    name: "Your Name",
    bio: "Your bio or tagline",
    profileImage: "url-to-your-image.jpg",
    // ...
};
```

### 2. Add/Edit Links
```javascript
links: [
    {
        title: "Link Title",
        url: "https://your-url.com",
        icon: "ðŸ”—" // Any emoji works!
    },
    // Add more links...
]
```

### 3. Customize Colors
To change the gradient background, edit the CSS in the `<style>` section:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

## Tips

1. **Profile Image**: Use a square image (1:1 ratio) for best results
2. **Icons**: You can use emojis or replace with SVG icons
3. **Links**: Add as many or as few links as you want
4. **Mobile**: The design automatically adapts to smaller screens
